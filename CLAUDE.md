- this project is a very simple snake game, implemented in vanilla javascript and HTML
- the entire project should be kept inside a single file
- the project needs to be responsive and should target laptops, tablets and phones
- simplicity is key here, both in the code structure and the features. Apply KISS principles
- the code should make use of modern code features and not try to keep backward compatibility with old browsers
