# claude-snake

A responsive Snake game built with vanilla HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Features smooth interpolated movement, dynamic speed scaling, touch controls for mobile, and randomly generated walls for added challenge.

This project has been vibe-coded by Claude on my tablet while I was waiting at the airport. I always liked snake, but it's difficult to find simple games that are not full of ads these days.
